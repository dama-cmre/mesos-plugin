<div>
    Specifies the additional JVM arguments to be used when invoking the Jenkins slave agent on the Mesos slave.
    <b>NOTE:</b> Any references to the "Xmx" JVM argument will be removed so that the maximum heap size available to the slave will be set dynamically based on the available memory.
    The total memory for the Mesos task or Docker container is derived from the following calculation:  Jenkins Slave Memory in MB + (number of Executors in Slave * Jenkins Executor Memory in MB).
    Xmx is set to that number, both in the slave JVM and in _JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable.
