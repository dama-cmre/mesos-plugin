    This will allow override default docker image using labels. Example if mesos slave has label MesosJenkinsAgent and you
    want to customize docker image then you will be able to set label in job like following:<br/>
    MesosJenkinsAgent:evarga/jenkins-slave:latest
    <br/>As a result this job will be executed on evarga/jenkins-slave docker image.
