    By default, the way in which mesos runs a docker based jenkins slave image is via  /bin/sh -c 'java -DHUDSON_HOME ...'
    Checking this option, and providing an appropriate value for the custom docker command shell parameter
    below, will provide a way to override this custom command shell. This is often required when trying to
    make use of a docker-in-docker (dind) image.
